The other core instrument we are responsible for is the Sonic Detection and Ranging Instrument (SODAR). The SODAR provides a vertical profile of wind speed, direction, and temperature up to several hundred meters above the surface! This enables measurements far above what a tower could measure, a benefit common to remote sensing instruments like this. The SODAR sends an audible “chirp” vertically, and measures the sound that returns back to the instrument, which can be converted to temperature and wind estimates. For this instrument, we leveled the wooden palette, connected the side panels, and anchored the instrument to the ground.","position":{"start":{"line":24,"column":1},"end":{"line":24,"column":1}},"key":"ZNLzJVQzj2"}],"key":"lCu68A9dUG"},{"type":"image","url":"/build/wfip-sodar-c1f7136d6bdfff51422bd11e3a92a1b1.jpg","alt":"SODAR instrument","position":{"start":{"line":26,"column":1},"end":{"line":26,"column":1}},"key":"foB3kfThhV","urlSource":"../images/wfip-sodar.jpg"},{"type":"heading","depth":2,"position":{"start":{"line":28,"column":1},"end":{"line":28,"column":1}},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Dinner (and Drinks)","position":{"start":{"line":28,"column":1},"end":{"line":28,"column":1}},"key":"JQBIS9POHQ"}],"identifier":"dinner-and-drinks","label":"Dinner (and Drinks)","html_id":"dinner-and-drinks","implicit":true,"key":"kLeL3WHyAj"},{"type":"paragraph","position":{"start":{"line":30,"column":1},"end":{"line":30,"column":1}},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"We finished the day by stopping at a local brewery, Cisco Brewing Company.
