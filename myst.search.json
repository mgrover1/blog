We will build the necessary tools to load radar data into the Pangeo-friendly standard data model - Xarray! Moving to this data model, will enable cross compatibility across the Pangeo stack, and conform to the proposed cfradial2 standard, which will soon be adopted by the World Meteorological Organization.\n\nA graphic from the cfradial2 standard is summarized below (thanks to Mark Curtis), highlighting the hierarchal data model approach, which aligns with the recently developed xarray-datatree package. The conference material will be available after the conference, so I encourage you check out the rest of Mark Curtis‚Äôs poster!\n\n\nCfradial2 data structure, as summarized by Mark Curtis in his poster.","type":"content","url":"/posts/2022/erad-2022-takeaways#the-pre-workshop-meeting","position":5},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"ERAD Takeaways","lvl3":"The Workshop","lvl2":"The Workshop"},"type":"lvl3","url":"/posts/2022/erad-2022-takeaways#the-workshop-1","position":6},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"ERAD Takeaways","lvl3":"The Workshop","lvl2":"The Workshop"},"content":"The workshop has been taught for a number of years, originally starting with a Virtual Machine approach that required users downloading the virtual machine software, importing the image, and running on their local laptop. We have since adapted the content to run on the Pangeo hub (using the Project Pythia cookbook theme), using the Jupyter stack (JupyterBook, JupyterHub, and Jupyter notebooks). Using this new stack led to a quicker time-to-science, which was amazing!\n\nIf you are interested in going through the content, here is a link to the book!\n\nopenradarscience‚Äã.org‚Äã/erad2022\n\nWe are appreciative of communities such as Pangeo, and organizations like 2i2c for making the setup and deployment of this workshop so straightforward and accessible.","type":"content","url":"/posts/2022/erad-2022-takeaways#the-workshop-1","position":7},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"ERAD Takeaways","lvl2":"The Conference"},"type":"lvl2","url":"/posts/2022/erad-2022-takeaways#the-conference","position":8},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"ERAD Takeaways","lvl2":"The Conference"},"content":"It was incredible seeing the variety of research presented at ERAD. Talks ranged from precipitation estimation methods to observations of bugs and birds across Europe. One major commonality across a collection of the talks was the reliance on open radar software. While not all the talks used Py-ART,   quite a few did, in addition to other packages such as wradlib, LROSE, or BALTRAD. It was inspiring to see so many members of the operational and research weather community using our software for their science.\n\nOne of the first talks, presented partly by Daniel Michelson, highlighted that the future of European weather radar data is open. They are working to open the shared radar data, currently only available to a small community, to the entire science community over the next few years. The key product they mentioned is a blended Europe-wide radar product.\n\nI also jotted down quite a few new ideas for improved visualization methods in Py-ART, where we can improve our documentation, and new blog posts highlighting how Py-ART is being used around the world. The first blog post we want to work with the Metoswiss folks to put together is one walking through how Meteoswiss uses Py-ART for qualitative precipitation estimation (QPE). This was one of the examples during the workshop, but it would be great to have a deeper dive into this workflow!","type":"content","url":"/posts/2022/erad-2022-takeaways#the-conference","position":9},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"ERAD Takeaways","lvl2":"The City"},"type":"lvl2","url":"/posts/2022/erad-2022-takeaways#the-city","position":10},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"ERAD Takeaways","lvl2":"The City"},"content":"The city of Locarno was gorgeous.

The size of each circle is set so that two-thirds of historical official forecast errors over a 5-year sample fall within the circle. The circle radii defining the cones in 2022 for the Atlantic, Eastern North Pacific, and Central North Pacific basins are given in the table below.\n\nOne can also examine historical tracks to determine how often the entire 5-day path of a cyclone remains completely within the area of the cone. This is a different perspective that ignores most timing errors. For example, a storm moving very slowly but in the expected direction would still be within the area of the cone, even though the track forecast error could be very large.

On Saturday, we spent a bulk of the day putting the final touches on the 10 meter meteorology tower, shown below.\n\nThis meteorology tower includes sonic anemometers (the big claw machine looking devices) at 10 meters (right portion of the picture) and 5 meters (left portion of the picture). These devices send ultrasonic sounds from each of those claws, and measure how the sound interacts with the air, which gives an estimate of the wind direction and speed, in all directions. These high resolution measurements are helpful when looking at how the surface interacts with the air above it, a key focus for this field experiment!\n\nWhile we were able to install all of the instruments on the tower, and test that they were collecting data, we were not able to fully raise the tower. We plan to return later this week (hopefully) to raise the tower.","type":"content","url":"/posts/2023/wfip3-day3-4#the-nantucket-tower","position":3},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Argonne Instruments at WFIP3: Days 3-4: A Full Weekend","lvl2":"Traveling to Martha‚Äôs Vineyard"},"type":"lvl2","url":"/posts/2023/wfip3-day3-4#traveling-to-marthas-vineyard","position":4},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Argonne Instruments at WFIP3: Days 3-4: A Full Weekend","lvl2":"Traveling to Martha‚Äôs Vineyard"},"content":"After securing all of our instruments at Nantucket, we traveled to the docks to catch the ferry back to the mainland, en route to our next site in Martha‚Äôs Vineyard.
