## Research

### Talks

I have given a couple of talks related to my Masters degree research, relating midlevel updraft structures, observed by ground-based radars, with overshooting tops, observed by satellites.

## Software
I have also presented several talks and posters on scientific software, workflows, and benchmarks.
