&lt;p&gt;September is fast approaching which marks six months since I started my role as a software engineer at the National Center for Atmospheric Research. It is crazy to think that just six months ago, I was pushing to finish the first draft of my Master’s Thesis. So much has changed since then.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started at the University of Illinois in the Atmospheric Science graduate program in Fall of 2019, after completing the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/blogs/news/entry/welcome-summer-intern-max-grover"&gt;Unidata Summer Internship Program&lt;/a&gt;, moving from Boulder to Champaign. I remember leaving one of the parks in the Table Mesa neighborhood thinking that I wanted to come back to Boulder at some point…&lt;/p&gt;
