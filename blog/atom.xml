    <title>Westward Bound: Midwestern Grad Student to a Colorado Software Engineer</title>

&lt;p&gt;September is fast approaching which marks six months since I started my role as a software engineer at the National Center for Atmospheric Research. It is crazy to think that just six months ago, I was pushing to finish the first draft of my Master’s Thesis. So much has changed since then.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started at the University of Illinois in the Atmospheric Science graduate program in Fall of 2019, after completing the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/blogs/news/entry/welcome-summer-intern-max-grover"&gt;Unidata Summer Internship Program&lt;/a&gt;, moving from Boulder to Champaign. I remember leaving one of the parks in the Table Mesa neighborhood thinking that I wanted to come back to Boulder at some point…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It has been a while since my last post! Over the past ~9 months, I started a new job at Argonne National Laboratory and relocated to the state of Illinois, more specifically the Western Suburbs of Chicago, Illinois. I work with Scott Collis, a scientist and Geospatial Computing, Innovations, and Sensing (GCIS) Department Head. He is also the inventor of the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://arm-doe.github.io/pyart/index.html"&gt;Python Atomspheric Radiation Measurement Toolkit (Py-ART)&lt;/a&gt;, one of the go-to packages when working with weather radar data in Python.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the nicest things about relocating is the proximity to my family in Wisconsin. I have gone back to see them several times already, spending quite a bit of time on Delavan Lake (shown below)
&lt;img alt="Delavan Lake Sunset Picture" src="../_images/delavan-lake-sunset.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last week, I attended the Earthcube Annual Meeting in San Diego, California!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earthcube is an organization, funded by the National Science Foundation, which is focused around facilitating communities and practices related to geoscience data and cyberinfrastructure (the computers + software needed to get science done). From their &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.earthcube.org/info"&gt;official information page&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This week, I attended the 11th  European Conference on Radar in Meteorology and Hydrology in Locarno, Switzerland! This conference brought a large community of weather forecast agencies (hosted by Meteoswiss, the Swiss weather service), researchers, software developers, vendors, and other members of the private sector.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The conference consisted of two main parts:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Within this post, we explore how we can use &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://hvplot.holoviz.org/"&gt;&lt;code class="docutils literal notranslate"&gt;&lt;span class="pre"&gt;hvPlot&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to plot data from Hurricane Ian, which will soon make landfall in Florida.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the end of this post, you will be able to recreate the following plot:

&lt;p&gt;It is hard to believe that tomorrow I will hop on a plane for AMS 2023. Am I prepared for all of my presentations, co-chair obligations, and general travel logistics? Absolutely not. I am however excited to reconnect with the weather community in beautiful Colorado, with this being the first in-person AMS Annual Meeting since January 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I typically reflect on conferences &lt;strong&gt;after&lt;/strong&gt; the event, I wanted to take this as an opportunity to express why the American Meteorological Society (AMS) Annual Meeting is such an amazing event, how it has influenced my career (and my life in general), as well as some general advice for the week!&lt;/p&gt;
