&lt;p&gt;September is fast approaching which marks six months since I started my role as a software engineer at the National Center for Atmospheric Research. It is crazy to think that just six months ago, I was pushing to finish the first draft of my Master’s Thesis. So much has changed since then.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started at the University of Illinois in the Atmospheric Science graduate program in Fall of 2019, after completing the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/blogs/news/entry/welcome-summer-intern-max-grover"&gt;Unidata Summer Internship Program&lt;/a&gt;, moving from Boulder to Champaign. I remember leaving one of the parks in the Table Mesa neighborhood thinking that I wanted to come back to Boulder at some point…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It has been a while since my last post! Over the past ~9 months, I started a new job at Argonne National Laboratory and relocated to the state of Illinois, more specifically the Western Suburbs of Chicago, Illinois. I work with Scott Collis, a scientist and Geospatial Computing, Innovations, and Sensing (GCIS) Department Head. He is also the inventor of the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://arm-doe.github.io/pyart/index.html"&gt;Python Atomspheric Radiation Measurement Toolkit (Py-ART)&lt;/a&gt;, one of the go-to packages when working with weather radar data in Python.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the nicest things about relocating is the proximity to my family in Wisconsin. I have gone back to see them several times already, spending quite a bit of time on Delavan Lake (shown below)

&lt;p&gt;It is hard to believe that tomorrow I will hop on a plane for AMS 2023. Am I prepared for all of my presentations, co-chair obligations, and general travel logistics? Absolutely not. I am however excited to reconnect with the weather community in beautiful Colorado, with this being the first in-person AMS Annual Meeting since January 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I typically reflect on conferences &lt;strong&gt;after&lt;/strong&gt; the event, I wanted to take this as an opportunity to express why the American Meteorological Society (AMS) Annual Meeting is such an amazing event, how it has influenced my career (and my life in general), as well as some general advice for the week!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last week, I attended the 103rd American Meteorological Society Annual Meeting in Denver Colorado. Prior to attending, I put together a blog post detailing my pre-conference thoughts and expressed a high level of excitement for this year’s conference. It did not disappoint. The week was full of meaningful connections with colleagues, leading an open science short course, and attending sessions where I learned new tools and techniques for working with atmospheric and climate datasets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The week started off with our “Open Science in the Rockies: Working with ARM Data from the Surface Atmosphere Integrated Field Laboratory” short course, with over 20 attendees! A good amount of preparation went into the course, from meeting room logistics, inviting speakers, and testing the cyberinfrastructure that would allow participants to analyze large datasets while on a limited conference internet network. The course started with an overview of the SAIL field campaign, quickly diving into ways to access the data and analyze the datasets using open-source tools funded and supported by ARM! We also covered advanced data visualization techniques using the Pangeo stack, including using Xarray and the Holoviews tools to visualize an entire day’s worth of high spatiotemporal cloud radar data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scorigami is an interesting concept. It’s an event in sports where a final score has never happened in its history. For example, in the &lt;a href='https://nflscorigami.com/' target="_blank"&gt;National Football League&lt;/a&gt;, a 20-17 score has happened over 285 times, but a 70-20 score has only happened once. When the Miami Dolphins beat the Denver Broncos 70-20 on September 24th, 2023, that was considered a scorigami!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today was the first day of my trip focused on deploying instruments from Argonne National Laboratory (ANL) (based in Lemont, Illinois), to the East Coast of the United States for the 3rd Wind Forecast Improvement Project (WFIP3). The project aims to improve wind forecasting ability within models, using both models and observations focused on offshore wind farms in the greater Boston, Massachusetts region. Argonne National Laboratory has a collection of instruments, most of which usually reside at the Argonne Testbed for Multiscale Observational Science (ATMOS) https://www.anl.gov/evs/atmos, which can be deployed for different scientific projects! Instruments at Argonne were deployed for previous Wind Forecast Improvement Projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The field sites are outlined in the graphic below, which can be found on the project website (https://www2.whoi.edu/site/wfip3/field-observations/)  )&lt;/p&gt;
