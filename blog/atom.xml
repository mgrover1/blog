&lt;p&gt;September is fast approaching which marks six months since I started my role as a software engineer at the National Center for Atmospheric Research. It is crazy to think that just six months ago, I was pushing to finish the first draft of my Master’s Thesis. So much has changed since then.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started at the University of Illinois in the Atmospheric Science graduate program in Fall of 2019, after completing the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/blogs/news/entry/welcome-summer-intern-max-grover"&gt;Unidata Summer Internship Program&lt;/a&gt;, moving from Boulder to Champaign. I remember leaving one of the parks in the Table Mesa neighborhood thinking that I wanted to come back to Boulder at some point…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It has been a while since my last post! Over the past ~9 months, I started a new job at Argonne National Laboratory and relocated to the state of Illinois, more specifically the Western Suburbs of Chicago, Illinois. I work with Scott Collis, a scientist and Geospatial Computing, Innovations, and Sensing (GCIS) Department Head. He is also the inventor of the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://arm-doe.github.io/pyart/index.html"&gt;Python Atomspheric Radiation Measurement Toolkit (Py-ART)&lt;/a&gt;, one of the go-to packages when working with weather radar data in Python.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the nicest things about relocating is the proximity to my family in Wisconsin. I have gone back to see them several times already, spending quite a bit of time on Delavan Lake (shown below)
