# About Me

I work as an Atmospheric Data Scientist at Argonne National Laboratory, where I contribute to tools and infrastructure to enable open science.

## What I do

**Open Source and Open Science**
```

```{div}
:class: col-body-right

I work on projects that make analyzing large atmospheric/climate datasets easier, and ensure folks have an inclusive community around the tools to support robust communities of practice.

I contribute to a few open-source projects that support the weather/climate community. In particular I am a core contributor to many projects in the [Pangeo ecosystem](https://pangeo.io/), and in particular the following major projects:

- [Python ARM Radar Toolkit (Py-ART)](https://arm-doe.github.io/pyart/) - a Python library containing a collection of weather radar algorithms and utilities.
- [xradar](https://docs.openradarscience.org/projects/xradar/en/stable/) - includes all the tools to get your bring weather radar data in the [pangeo ecosystem](https://pangeo.io/).
- [intake-esm](https://intake-esm.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) - a data cataloging utility built on top of intake, pandas, and xarray, and itâ€™s pretty awesome!
- [The Open Radar Forum](https://openradar.discourse.group/) - a place for the weather radar community to come together.

I regularly teach short-courses at academic meetings, including the American Meteorological Society (AMS)Meetings (Radar and Annual), European Conference on Radar in Meteorology and Hydrology, as well as smaller workshops and webinars.

I am also involved as co-chair of the AMS Committee on Environmental Information Processing Technologies, as well as co-chair for the Earth, Ocean, Geo, and Atmospheric Science track at the annual [scientific python conference](https://www.scipy2024.scipy.org/).

**2022**: Joined [Argonne National Laboratory](https://www.anl.gov/) as an Atmospheric Data Scientist
^^^

Argonne National Laboratory is a Department Energy Office of Science facility, where I work on projects
related to open atmospheric and climate science. Key programs/projects I work on include:

- **[ARM User Facility](https://arm.gov)**
- **[Open Radar Community](https://openradarscience.org/)**
- **[Earth System Grid Federation](https://esgf.llnl.gov/)**
- **[CROCUS UIFL](https://crocus-urban.org)**

**2021**: Joined NCAR
^^^

After finishing graduate school at the University of Illinois, I began my data science career at the [National Center for Atmospheric Research](https://ncar.ucar.edu/), where I focused on developing open-source tools for the Climate and Global Dynamics laboratory, specifically those working with the Community Earth System Model (CESM). Here are a few of the main things I did during this time:

- Kickstarted the [Earth System Data Science](https://ncar.github.io/esds) initiative, writing 52 blog posts for the project.
- Co-lead development of [intake-esm](https://github.com/intake/intake-esm), a tool used for organizing petabyte-scale climate model datasets.
- Hosted office hours for the community to ask [pangeo-related](https://pangeo.io/) questions, building a community of practice around common analysis workflows.

**Fall 2019**: Started graduate school at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign
^^^

My scientific training began as an atmospheric scientist, where I studied deep convective storm dynamics in South America. I used observations from the [RELAMPAGO-CACTI](https://www.eol.ucar.edu/field_projects/relampago) field campaign, which focused on some of the largest storms on earth, located in the Sierras de Cordoba region of Argentina. In particular I focused on relating observations from space-borne satellites to ground-based radars.

**Summer 2019**: Interned at [Unidata](https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/)

Unidata (a National Science Foundation funded organization) is a diverse community of education and research institutions with the common goal of sharing geoscience data and the tools to access and visualize that data. During my time there, I spent most of my time adding a [METAR parser](https://unidata.github.io/MetPy/latest/api/generated/metpy.io.parse_metar_file.html#metpy.io.parse_metar_file) to [MetPy](https://unidata.github.io/MetPy/latest/), the go-to python library for working with weather data.
