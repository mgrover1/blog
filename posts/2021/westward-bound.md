# Westward Bound: Midwestern Grad Student to SE along the Front Range

September is fast approaching will mark six months since I started my role as a software engineer at the National Center for Atmospheric Research. It is crazy to think that just six months ago, I was pushing to finish the first draft of my Master's Thesis. So much has changed since then.

## Finishing Graduate School During a Pandemic

I started at the University of Illinois in the Atmospheric Science graduate program in Fall of 2019, after completing the [Unidata Summer Internship Program](https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/blogs/news/entry/welcome-summer-intern-max-grover), moving from Boulder to Champaign. I remember leaving one of the parks in the Table Mesa neighborhood thinking that I wanted to come back to Boulder at some point...

We only had ~ 7 months of "normalcy" before classes switched to a virtual format, leaving most of us back

## Transitioning from Observational Mesoscale Meteorology to Software Engineering in the Ocean Section

When I found out that I would be working with the biogeochemistry group in the ocean section within the Climate and Global Dynamics Lab at NCAR, I was honestly terrified. I have **never** taken an oceanography class before, nor have I ever worked with ocean model output. The last time I learned about biology was my first year of high school. To say I was out of my comfort zone would be an understatement. I was both excited to learn about a new field, while also terrified that I would be responsible for developing for data I have never worked with.

Fortunately, meeting my fellow group members and coworkers, as well as connecting with those in the Pangeo community helped address these fears.
