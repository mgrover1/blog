Hello! I am a fortunate enough to work as a software engineer at the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR)
within the Climate and Global Dynamics Lab (CGD), focused on developing open-source tools to improve how we work with climate and weather datasets. While my background is in meteorology and atmospheric science, my passion is in software engineering, working with scientists to find ways to improve their data workflows.
