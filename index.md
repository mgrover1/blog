Hello! I am a fortunate enough to work as a software developer at Argonne National Laboratory, primarily working with the Atmospheric Radiation Measurement Facility, focused on developing open-source tools to improve how we work with climate and weather datasets. While my background is in meteorology and atmospheric science, my passion is in software engineering, working with scientists to find ways to improve their software tools and general data workflows, advocating for open science practices.
