# About

## Software
In my role as a software engineer at the [National Center for Atmospheric Research](http://ncar.ucar.edu), I work on a wide variety of projects. A few of the primary include

### [NCAR Earth System Data Science Initiative](http://ncar.github.io/esds)
We are working on building a sociotechincal network within NCAR to support analysis workflows, focusing on:
- Education
- A platform to ask questions and find support
- Presentations on Works-In-Progress
- Focused development efforts around specific packages

### [Earth System Model Catalog Tools](https://ecgtools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
A tool for building [intake-esm](https://intake-esm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) data catalogs, providing a simplified data api to catalog files and query data assets

### [Funnel](https://github.com/NCAR/esds-funnel)
A package/project which couples data operators (such as climatological or zonal means) and data catalogs, extending these catalogs by providing a unified api

## Research
Prior to starting my software engineering role at NCAR, I worked as a graduate research assistant at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. Feel free to check out my [google scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ZQMa8CkAAAAJ&hl=en) for the latest updates.

### [RELAMPAGO-CACTI Field Campaign](https://sites.google.com/illinois.edu/relampago/home)
During my time at Illinois, I worked with observational data from the RELAMPAGO-CACTI Field Campaign, which took place in the Sierras de Cordoba region in South America. Although I did not travel and participate in the data collection, I analyzed radar, satellite, and soundings, focusing on relating midlevel updraft structure with storm top cloud structures.
