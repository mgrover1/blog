# About

## Software

I now work as a software developer for the Department of Energy (DOE) [Atmospheric Radation Measurement (ARM) user facility](https://www.arm.gov) at [Argonne National Laboratory](https://www.anl.gov) in Lemont, Illinois. A few of the projects I work on at Argonne inlcude:

### [The Python-ARM Radar Toolkit (PyART)](https://github.com/ARM-DOE/pyart)
Which is a data model driven interactive toolkit for working with weather radar data. The package focuses on:
- Input/Output
- Radar data processing
- Visualization

### [The Atmospheric data Community Toolkit (ACT)](https://github.com/ARM-DOE/ACT)
Whis is a python based toolkit for exploring and analyzing time series atmospheric datasets. Key components here include:
- Data discovery
- Simplified I/O
- Plotting utilities

I was previously employed at the [National Center for Atmospheric Research](http://ncar.ucar.edu), where I worked on a wide variety of projects. A few of the primary projects include:

### [NCAR Earth System Data Science Initiative](http://ncar.github.io/esds)
We are working on building a sociotechincal network within NCAR to support analysis workflows, focusing on:
- Education
- A platform to ask questions and find support
- Presentations on Works-In-Progress
- Focused development efforts around specific packages

### [Earth System Model Catalog Tools](https://ecgtools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
A tool for building [intake-esm](https://intake-esm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) data catalogs, providing a simplified data api to catalog files and query data assets

### [Funnel](https://github.com/NCAR/esds-funnel)
A package/project which couples data operators (such as climatological or zonal means) and data catalogs, extending these catalogs by providing a unified api

## Research
Prior to starting my software engineering role at NCAR, I worked as a graduate research assistant at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. Feel free to check out my [google scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ZQMa8CkAAAAJ&hl=en) for the latest updates.

### [RELAMPAGO-CACTI Field Campaign](https://sites.google.com/illinois.edu/relampago/home)
During my time at Illinois, I worked with observational data from the RELAMPAGO-CACTI Field Campaign, which took place in the Sierras de Cordoba region in South America. Although I did not travel and participate in the data collection, I analyzed radar, satellite, and soundings, focusing on relating midlevel updraft structure with storm top cloud structures.
